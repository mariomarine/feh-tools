## Fire Emblem: Heroes Tools

This repository is my collection of tools I can use to better understand my choices within FEH.

### Summon Simulator

The Summon Simulator is designed to give statistics on how many orbs it takes to get focus heroes (or other stars potentially?)

See [Summon Simulator](https://github.com/mariomarine/feh-tools/tree/master/summon_sim) for more information.

### Hero Helper

This is dsigned to, eventually, provide guidance for picking out skills for your characters.
